        <hr />
        <p>The IST Open Source Software Lab was initiated as a start-up grant proposal by its founder – Dr. Mathias Fonkam – as part of his hiring package. It was funded by the then Dean of IST – Dr. Andrew Sears starting Fall 2023 for whom we owe much gratitude.</p>
        <p>Dr. Carl Cortner was the first faculty colleague to partner with Dr. Fonkam, not just to secure a physical location for the lab, but also to brainstorm on some of the focus areas of interest. Dr. Cortner was instrumental in securing a work area for the lab from then Acting Dean Tapia in the Summer of 2023. We are grateful for the support from Dean Tapia.</p>
        <p>In the Fall of 2023, Mr. Jeff Schulman joined us as a faculty mentor for the lab. We officially started the lab activities Fall 2023 recruiting about 20 students, setting up a Canvas Site for the Lab, organizing about 4 meetings with the mentors and students that semester. The Canvas Site served as a platform for communications, collaborations and sharing of important open-source content with the group, especially the student interest group that we formed within the lab that semester.</p>
        <p>Now, in 2024 we are also launching this website to be an additional source of collaboration and information for students interested in Open Source software.</p>
