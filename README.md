# OSSIG-Website
The following repository is a collection of various elements I am using in the development of the Penn State Open Source Software Interest Group's (OSSIG) website. Please note that this repository does not currently contain all the source code used in the website. The code here will eventually be licensed as open source.

Once I have a general idea of what open source licences are correct to use, and what licences are needed to allow any propritary bits used that I do not own but are allowed use of for the project (such as color schemes specific to my univerisity), I will designate a correct licence and release it under such licence.
